The region now known as Haryana has been the birthplace of the Hindu religion and many ancient civilizations. Urban settlements in Ghaggar Valley date from 3000 BC. It was the home of the legendary Bharata dynasty. The Mahabharata's epic battle between the Kauravas and Pandavas took place at Kurukshetra. Incorporated into the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BC, the area later became a power base for the Mughals.

Geographically located at 30.73째 N and 76.78째 E, Haryana lies in the northern part of India. Parts of it are included in the National Capital Region (NCR). It is bordered by Himachal Pradesh and Punjab in the north, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the east, and Rajasthan in the south and west.
